# Starbound-bardez-mORE-Liquids-Furnace

This repo is a mod for [Starbound](https://playstarbound.com/), based on top of the following mods:
- [mORE Liquids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1318339314)
- [Molten Liquids tabs for Furnace](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2895554927)

This mod does the following:
- Moves the pixel compressor recipes from mORE Liquids to atomic furnace
- Moves the recipes to the furnace's new tabs
- Allows the recipes to be crafted in appropriate generations, as follows
  - Primitive Furnace:
    - Molten/Bar Copper
    - Molten/Bar Gold
    - Molten/Bar Iron
    - Molten/Bar Silver
    - Molten/Bar Tungsten
  - Industrial Furnace:
    - Molten/Bar Titanium
  - Atomic Furnace:
    - Molten/Ore Coal
    - Molten/Currency Pixel
- Leaves the existing furnace3 and pixelcompressor recipe files in-place but edits them to point elsewhere
  - It's sloppy, but does enable better mod inter-compatability :(
